# SauceDemoAutomationFramework

## Summary
This automation framework tests the functionality of the SauceDemo web application by simulating user activities through test scripts and feature files. The automation framework is built using Java, Selenium, and JUnit 5, while incorporating design patterns such as: Page Object Model, Page Factory, and Dependency Injection. Through these design patterns, the web application page objects and test cases are decoupled from the framework. Therefore, the framework's setup can be reused to automate other web applications, while also capable of extending and adapting to the specific testing requirements for each application.
